- Included one preset - TA_warm_wed.lrtemplate
- The file type: .lrtemplate
- Designed to be used with: RAW, JPG
- Need some changes with over- and underexposed images
- Lightroom: 3.x or above


And there are a little guide to make your photos better.

You must understand that Lightroom presets have a better compatibility when they are used for a similar images. 
Example: when you are using a warm preset, which is based on cold image, you should do the same, take your COLD(!) image, and use this preset. (DONT use it on warm image)
If you use it, on warm image, you will get too much warming, because it will multiply. 

BUT(!) if you want to use it on every image, you - can. Use it, then in "Basic" change "Temp" to the left side, until you will be happy.
