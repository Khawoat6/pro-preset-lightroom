- The file type: .lrtemplate
- Designed to be used with: RAW, JPG, TIFF
- Need some changes with over- and underexposed
- Lightroom: 3.x or above


And there are a little guide to make your photos better.

You must understand that Lightroom presets have a better compatibility when they are used for a similar images. 
Example: when you are using a warm preset, which is based on cold image, you should do the same, take your COLD(!) image, and use this preset. (DONT use it on warm image)
If you use it on warm image, you will get too much warming, because it will multiply. 

BUT(!) if you want to use it on every image, you - can. Use it, then in "Basic" change "Temp" to the left side if it warm, and to the right side if it cold, until you will be happy.

Hope my giude will help you. If you have any more questions, write it to - zvolia@gmail.com and i will answer as fast as i can.
